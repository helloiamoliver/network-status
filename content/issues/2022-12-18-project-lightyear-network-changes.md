As Project Lightyear nears completion, we look towards the sunsetting of our existing systems.

**All devices have been transferred to the Ultrafast Fatrat network, or to the IoT network**
As a result, legacy systems (such as 'Superfast Fatrat', or 'SMART HOME DEVICES') were shut-down at 15:40GMT on 23 December 2022.

If you are having an issue with a device on the WiFi, please contact 2 The Folly IT Support.
