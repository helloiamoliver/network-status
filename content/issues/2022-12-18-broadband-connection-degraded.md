*Monitoring* - Due to the rain, we are experiencing intermittent connectivity issues over our ADSL telephone line.
We are monitoring the situation closely, and hope that it will resolve with an improvement in weather.

Until this happens, please be aware of the following:

- Network speeds may be slower than usual.
- The internet connection may fail entirely with no notice.
- Streaming or downloading large files may not be possible.
